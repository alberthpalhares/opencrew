# Task-Based Agent Execution

> Part of the Pipeline Runner (`_opencrew/core/runner.pipeline.md`). Read it only when the agent of the step has a `tasks:` field in its frontmatter.

When an agent's `.agent.md` frontmatter contains a `tasks:` field:

1. **Load task list**: Read the `tasks:` array from the agent's frontmatter
   - Each entry is a relative path to a task file (e.g., `tasks/analyze-source.md`)
   - Tasks execute in the order listed

2. **For each task in sequence**:
   a. Read the task file from the agent's directory (`crews/{crew-name}/agents/{agent-id}/tasks/{task}.md`: a folder with the agent id, next to the agent file)
   b. Construct the execution prompt:
      - Agent persona + principles (from agent.md — fixed across all tasks)
      - Task description and process (from task file)
      - Task output format (from task file)
      - Task quality criteria and veto conditions (from task file)
      - Input: For the first task, use the step's input. For subsequent tasks, use the previous task's output.
   c. Execute the task (inline or subagent, matching the step's execution mode)
   d. Collect the task output
   e. Check task veto conditions (same enforcement as the step veto conditions: "Veto Condition Enforcement", in the runner)

3. **Final output**: The output of the LAST task in the chain becomes the step's output
   - Resolve the `outputFile` path with the `saida` command (Output Path Transformation) before saving — this applies regardless of whether the step runs as `execution: inline` or `execution: subagent`
   - Save to the **transformed** outputFile path
   - This is what the next step (or checkpoint) receives

4. **Progress reporting**: For inline execution, announce each task:
   ```
   {icon} {Agent Name} — Task {N}/{total}: {task name}...
   ```

5. **Backward compatibility**: If the agent's frontmatter does NOT contain a `tasks:` field,
   execute the agent monolithically as before (current behavior unchanged).
